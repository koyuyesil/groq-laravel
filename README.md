- **Flexible Configuration:** Define multiple Groq API instances, customize request timeouts, configure caching options, and adjust the package's behavior to suit your needs.
- **Detailed Practical Examples:** Explore code examples that demonstrate how to use the Groq Laravel package in real-world scenarios, including chatbots, audio transcription, and more.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Ensure the quality and reliability of the package with a suite of tests covering integration, unit testing, and configuration.

## Installation

1. Install the package via Composer:

   ```bash
   composer require lucianotonet/groq-laravel
   ```

2. Publish the configuration file:

   ```bash
   php artisan vendor:publish --provider="LucianoTonet\GroqLaravel\GroqServiceProvider"
   ```

3. Configure your Groq API credentials in the `.env` file:

   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   GROQ_API_BASE=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
   ```

4. (Optional) Configure caching by setting the following environment variables in the `.env` file:

   ```
   GROQ_CACHE_DRIVER=file
   GROQ_CACHE_TTL=3600
   ```

5. Import the `Groq` facade into your classes:

   ```php
   use LucianoTonet\GroqLaravel\Facades\Groq;
   ```

## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to create a chat completion:

```php
$response = Groq::chat()->completions()->create([
    'model' => 'llama-3.1-8b-instant',
    'messages' => [
        ['role' => 'user', 'content' => 'Hello, how are you?'],
    ],
]);
```

## Error Handling

The Groq Laravel package makes it easy to handle errors that may occur when interacting with the Groq API. Use a `try-catch` block to capture and manage exceptions:

```php
try {
    $response = Groq::chat()->completions()->create([
        'model' => 'llama-3.1-8b-instant',
        // ...
    ]);
} catch (GroqException $e) {
    Log::error('Error in Groq API: ' . $e->getMessage());
    abort(500, 'Error processing your request.');
}
```

## Vision API

The Groq Laravel package also provides access to the Groq Vision API, allowing you to analyze images and extract information from them.

**Example of use with image URL:**

```php
use LucianoTonet\GroqLaravel\Facades\Groq;

// ...

$imageUrl = 'https://example.com/image.jpg'; // Replace with your image URL
$prompt = 'Describe the image';

$response = Groq::vision()->analyze($imageUrl, $prompt);

$imageDescription = $response['choices'][0]['message']['content'];

// ... do something with the image description
```

**Example of use with local image file:**

```php
use LucianoTonet\GroqLaravel\Facades\Groq;

// ...

$imagePath = '/path/to/your/image.jpg'; // Replace with the actual path
$prompt = 'What do you see in this image?';

$response = Groq::vision()->analyze($imagePath, $prompt);

$imageAnalysis = $response['choices'][0]['message']['content'];

// ... do something with the image analysis
```

**Remember:**
- The Vision API requires a model compatible with image analysis, such as `llava-v1.5-7b-4096-preview`. You can configure the default model for Vision in the `config/groq.php` configuration file.
- The Vision API is an experimental feature and may not meet expectations, as well as not having long-term support.

## Testing

Testing is an essential part of quality software development. The Groq Laravel package includes a test suite that covers integration, unit, and configuration. To run the tests, follow the steps below:

1. **Install the project dependencies:**

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

2. **Run the tests:**

   ```bash
   vendor/bin/phpunit ./tests/Feature
   ```

   or individually:

   ```bash
   vendor/bin/phpunit ./tests/Feature/FacadeTest.php
   ```
